# MT5 Indicators
MT5 Indicators based on the PropSense Strategy.

The PropSense indicator can be configured to only create books during market sessions. The Market Sessions codebase is used as the basis for this determination.

The Market Sessions indicator can be used on its own for visual representation of active sessions as well as upcoming future sessions but you can also configure the PropSense indicator to show the sessions if you prefer.

The Market Sessions codebase adapts to Daylight Savings Time automatically which can be helpful if back testing. If this behaviour is not preferred, selecting the Asian session in the configuration for the session will keep the times unaltered.
